# Notes just for doing stuff

- Change `yard` in requirements and listings and rental properties to integers, so that we can compare yard sizes between requirements and listings/properties
- remove `type` from landlord
- make `agent_email` in `Client` nullable in the database and forward engineer
- ask TA for permission to use Express instead of ASP.NET asap
- add on change cascade to primary keys
- TODO need to add delete methods for all /{identifier} api paths
